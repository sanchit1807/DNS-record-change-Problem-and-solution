Got it — here’s a clear, do-this-then-that guide to stop the “switching” and kill the SSL error. Pick one path and follow it end-to-end.

Step 0 — What’s happening

Your hostname sometimes resolves to Cloudflare IPs and sometimes to the AWS ALB. A hostname must not have both A/AAAA records and a CNAME at the same time. That split routing is what leads to TLS confusion.

Option A — Use Cloudflare as the front door (recommended if you want WAF, CDN, DDoS)
A1) Confirm who’s authoritative

At your domain registrar, make sure the zone’s NS records point to Cloudflare’s nameservers.

From a shell:
nslookup -type=ns pico-rivera.org
The answers should be Cloudflare names like abby.ns.cloudflare.com, etc.

A2) Clean up DNS in Cloudflare (DNS tab)

Delete any A or AAAA records for nextgen311.pico-rivera.org.

Create a CNAME:

Name: nextgen311

Target: engagedxprod-1904748490.us-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com

Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud = ON)

If you have any duplicate records for this host in another DNS provider (e.g., Route 53), remove them. Only Cloudflare should be authoritative.

A3) SSL/TLS settings in Cloudflare (SSL/TLS tab)

Mode: Full (Strict)

Minimum TLS: 1.2

TLS 1.3: Enabled

A4) Origin (AWS ALB)

Listener :443 attached to an ACM cert that includes nextgen311.pico-rivera.org (you already have one).

Use a modern TLS security policy (TLS 1.2/1.3).

(Optional hardening) Remove legacy CBC ciphers if you’re allowed to choose a stricter policy.

(Optional) Restrict ALB security group to Cloudflare IP ranges.

A5) Verify

Flush caches: ipconfig /flushdns (Windows)
Chrome: chrome://net-internals/#sockets → “Flush sockets”

DNS should return only Cloudflare IPs now:
nslookup nextgen311.pico-rivera.org

TLS to origin OK:
openssl s_client -connect <ALB_DNS_NAME>:443 -servername nextgen311.pico-rivera.org | openssl x509 -noout -subject -issuer

Browser test the site. Error should be gone.

Option B — Go direct to the AWS ALB (no Cloudflare)
B1) Make your public zone authoritative (if not Cloudflare)

If your NS at the registrar point to Route 53 (or another provider), keep only that provider authoritative.

B2) Clean up DNS (in Route 53 or your provider)

Remove any A/AAAA records for nextgen311.pico-rivera.org that point to Cloudflare (104.21.x.x, 172.67.x.x, IPv6 2606:4700:…).

Create a CNAME:

Name: nextgen311.pico-rivera.org

Value: engagedxprod-1904748490.us-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com

TTL: 60–300s while testing

Note: CNAME is fine here because nextgen311 is a subdomain (not the zone apex).

B3) ALB TLS

Listener :443 with your ACM cert that includes nextgen311.pico-rivera.org.

Choose a modern TLS policy (TLS 1.2/1.3).

(Optional) Add HTTP→HTTPS redirect on the 80 listener.

B4) Verify

Flush caches: ipconfig /flushdns

Check DNS shows only the ALB:
nslookup -type=cname nextgen311.pico-rivera.org
nslookup nextgen311.pico-rivera.org (should return only ALB IPs)

Check certificate over SNI:
openssl s_client -connect nextgen311.pico-rivera.org:443 -servername nextgen311.pico-rivera.org | openssl x509 -noout -subject -issuer

Browser test the site.

If you still see both Cloudflare and ALB after changes

You’re likely editing the wrong zone or have split-horizon DNS.

Check the authoritative NS again:
nslookup -type=ns pico-rivera.org

Query a public resolver (bypasses your LAN DNS):
nslookup nextgen311.pico-rivera.org 1.1.1.1
nslookup nextgen311.pico-rivera.org 8.8.8.8

If your office DNS (e.g., 192.168.0.1) shows different answers, fix/flush that internal DNS server.

Quick command bundle (copy/paste)
# Who’s authoritative
nslookup -type=ns pico-rivera.org

# What the world sees (two resolvers)
nslookup nextgen311.pico-rivera.org 1.1.1.1
nslookup nextgen311.pico-rivera.org 8.8.8.8

# Any conflicting records
nslookup -type=any nextgen311.pico-rivera.org 1.1.1.1

# Verify certificate via SNI (should show your ACM subject & Amazon issuer)
openssl s_client -connect nextgen311.pico-rivera.org:443 -servername nextgen311.pico-rivera.org | openssl x509 -noout -subject -issuer

Which should you choose?

Option A (Cloudflare): if you want CDN/WAF/DDoS protection and to lock the origin to Cloudflare only.

Option B (Direct ALB): simpler, fewer moving parts.

Follow the option you prefer, and run the verify commands at the end. If anything doesn’t match what I described (e.g., you still see mixed answers), tell me which option you took and which DNS provider’s console you’re editing, and I’ll tailor the exact record entries to your zone.
